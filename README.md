# destroy-mobi
Using Calibre to manage ebooks on your Kindle? You might need this...

When you load a MOBI file into Calibre, it adds a tag (I think it's [PRVT]) to make the file private. You have to re-convert the MOBI files, which leaves a *.mobi file and a *.original_mobi file in the directory.

This script simply removes the *.original_mobi files.

It's really not rocket science.
